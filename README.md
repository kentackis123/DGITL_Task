### Hi, DGITL,
I accomplished the task to the best of my knowledge and it's up for your judgement now.
### There are several things I'd like to mention:
1. I used MobX instead of Redux, which I'm more familiar with (tho using Redux is fairly similair).
2. Input validation is working according to the task - alphanumeric values.
3. I used Postman API mock.


Cheers!

Giedrius.
